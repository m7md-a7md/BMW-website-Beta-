        <h2>  THE BMW STORE HISTORY </h2>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
          Here at The BMW Store we’ve done a lot in 4 decades and are very proud of our past and looking forward to an incredible future. Our customers have taken us a long way but here’s a little bit about how it all started! 
          
          It was in 1979 that Tom Schwartz obtained his franchise from BMW. Prior to that, he had been deeply involved with BMWs as a technician. From 1971 – 1976, Tom ran an independent service repair business called The BMW Store. With those roots, his dealership has always placed a premium on customer service with the goal of assuring customers a hassle-free ownership experience. Today, nearly 125 employees at The BMW Store are dedicated to helping people discover the joys of driving a BMW.
          
          There’s a highly trained, knowledgeable sales staff for both new and pre-owned BMWs, an inventory of over 100 new and 90 pre-owned BMWs is maintained to provide excellent selection, and master technicians head service teams specialized in the various operating systems of BMWs. Our extensive assortment of well-maintained pre-owned cars are showcased in our state-of-the art Cincinnati showroom. These include BMW models, as well as those made by other marques. If you find it here, rest assured it’s carefully chosen. If you don’t see a particular vehicle, visit our Vehicle Finder Service and complete the form. We will gladly inform you when a matching car arrives.
          
          We provide competitive BMW financing and lease options available for drivers from Cincinnati, Hyde Park, Oakley, Mariemont, Madeira, Indian Hill, Blue Ash, Montgomery, Loveland, Mason, Milford, Newport, KY, Ft. Thomas, KY, Ft. Mitchell, KY, Covington, KY, Newport, KY, Villa Hills, KY, Edgewood, KY, Florence, KY, and Northern Kentucky. Our finance managers work hard so that you are provided the best BMW financing available to you.
          
          A recently expanded service bay features 28 lifts. More than three quarters of a million dollars in parts are kept on site for quick service, and there’s a fleet of well maintained courtesy vehicles for your servicing convenience…not to mention our new state-of-the-art facility that opened in October 2016!
          
          Providing state-of-the-art support for BMW drivers is the natural culmination of The BMW Store’s passion for the marque. And for thousands of BMW customers in the Tri-State area, it’s one more reason why they choose to drive a BMW.
         
          <h3>WHY PURCHASE A BMW FROM THE BMW STORE?</h3>

      <ul>
          <li><b>Since we only sell BMWs, it enables us to have BMW as our sole product focus</b></li>
          <li><b>We have a large and knowledgeable staff that bases their values on customer service and passion for the vehicles</b></li>
          <li><b>Our motto says it all, Passion Loves Company®. Join us!</b></li>
      </ul>
          With so many dealers out there – it is important to find one that you can trust – as well as enjoy visiting! If you aren’t a customer already we invite you to see why, for 45 years, customers have continually returned to The BMW Store.
